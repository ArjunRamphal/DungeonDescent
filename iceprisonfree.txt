The goblin rubs his freed wrists, wincing as circulation returns to his fingers. Then he looks up at you, his yellowed eyes narrowing in something between amusement and pity.

"Didn't expect that," he mutters. "Most folks wouldn't bother with the likes of me."

You sheath your blade. "I don’t have time for this. Malvel has the princess locked away, and I need to—"

The goblin snorts. "Locked away? Hah. That what she told ya?"

You pause. "What do you mean?"

He stretches, rolling his shoulders, but doesn't answer right away. Instead, he paces toward the cell door, peering into the torch-lit corridor beyond. "Hero shows up, cuts down Malvel, saves the princess… seen it before. Almost like a story playin’ out the same way, over and over."

You feel a prickle of unease. "What are you trying to say?"

The goblin looks back at you, his grin sharp. "Just that things ain't always what they seem. Maybe you oughta ask the princess why Malvel kept her here, instead of just runnin’ her through."

Your fingers tighten around your sword hilt. "You're saying there's more to this?"

The goblin laughs, already slipping into the shadows of the corridor. "I ain't sayin’ nothin'. Just figured you deserved to know there's another door past the Hall of Chains. Might be worth seein’ what's on the other side… 'fore you go playin’ hero for someone who ain't askin’ to be saved."

And then he's gone, leaving you alone with the weight of his words.
