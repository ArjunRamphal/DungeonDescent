You trudge through the dense, overgrown corridors, your footsteps muffled by damp earth and tangled roots. You come to a cell, its iron door covered in a thick layer of moss and creeping vines. Inside, a small, wiry creature hangs from the wall, its wrists and ankles bound by rusty chains.

The creature, a goblin, looks up at you with a mixture of fear and desperation in its eyes. It speaks in a raspy, high-pitched voice.

"P-please, adventurer... don't leave me here! The Jungle Warden's hunters will come for me soon, and... and they'll make me suffer."

As you gaze at the goblin, you sense that it might possess valuable information about the Jungle Wardenâ€™s stronghold or the surrounding untamed wilderness. Perhaps it's worth sparing its life... for now.

However, a darker voice within you whispers that killing the goblin could grant you a boost in strength, agility, or vitality. The goblin's pitiful form seems almost... insignificant.
